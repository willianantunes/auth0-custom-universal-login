# Auth0 Custom Universal Login

This was created only for testing purposes. Please do not consider using it in a production environment. I just did it to quickly test what is available on Auth0.

## Deploying the project

When you think it's done the way you developed your custom page with either with [Auth0.js](https://github.com/auth0/auth0.js) or [Lock.js](https://github.com/auth0/lock), now you can deploy it on your tenant. To do that, change `.env.development` according to your scenario, and then you can issue the command:

    docker-compose up

You'll see something like this:

```shell
Starting auth0-custom-universal-login_apply-page-classic_1 ... done
Attaching to auth0-custom-universal-login_apply-page-classic_1

apply-page-classic_1  | CSS and JS files have been uploaded
apply-page-classic_1  | Login page has been updated successfully
apply-page-classic_1  | HTML file has been updated on Auth0
auth0-custom-universal-login_apply-page-classic_1 exited with code 0
```

It's worth mentioning that both JS and CSS files will be uploaded to an S3 bucket from AWS. If you'd like another blob storage, just change the script to match your needs.
